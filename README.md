- 👋 Hi, I’m @kmazmaen-mahatub
- 👀 I’m interested in Research on the Existence of One Way Function, software development and Artificial Intelligence.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning flutter.
- 💞️ I’m looking to admit on Grand Valley State University for my dream research which is to prove the existence of a One-way Function and want to develop some projects on there beside my academic career.
- 📫 Anybody can reach me via email.
